- Remove Cursewords code and make starter template
- Work on dictionary set-up to filter all_words.txt to only 5 letter alphabetic words only
- Create wordle_solver.

1st version:
code maintains 3 buckets of letters: unknown, notinword, inword.
code maintains dictionary of letter to location


User provides first word
Code updates inword vector and notinword vector
Code runs through words.txt and creates list of words that contain all letters of inword, and none of letters in notinword. Should check for location of words too.

Things to implement/do:

1. Test cases
2. Buff up README with example playthrough description
3. Button options for various things (h for help, f to finish, r to reset, d to debug mode)
4. Make data structure class for all the game mode tracking data.
5. Make game mode for sequence?
6. Analyze and optimize algorithm runtime and memory
7. Add output of potential words that'd optimize remaining words if all tried letters were grey
7. Build a friendly frontend UI for this to be more usable
